# Vigil — Development Roadmap

Each phase ends with a working, runnable binary. No phase leaves the project broken.

---

## Phase 0 — Scaffolding ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Name chosen: **Vigil**
- [x] Architecture decided (tokio + egui + ETW)
- [x] CLAUDE.md written
- [x] ROADMAP.md written
- [x] `cargo init vigil` at `C:\dev\vigil`
- [x] `Cargo.toml` with all dependencies (516 crates resolved)
- [x] `.gitignore`
- [x] `src/main.rs` stub — prints "Vigil v0.1.0 — scaffold OK"
- [x] `cargo build` succeeded (2m 31s first build; incremental will be seconds)

**Verified:** `./target/debug/vigil.exe` → `Vigil v0.1.0 — scaffold OK`

---

## Phase 1 — Core Types + Config ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** the data layer compiles clean and config survives a round-trip.

- [x] `src/types.rs` — `ConnInfo`, `ConnEvent`, `TrayState`, `MonitorMsg`
- [x] `src/config.rs` — `Config` struct with serde, compiled-in defaults JSON,
      `load()`, `save()`, `add_trusted()`, `remove_trusted()`, `get_trusted()`
- [x] `src/score.rs` — `score(conn: &PartialConn, proc: &ProcessInfo, cfg: &Config) -> (u8, Vec<String>)`
      Threat scoring engine with 6 point cases, fully unit-tested.
- [x] Unit tests: `cargo test` — all score cases pass (6/6 score cases, 19 tests total)

**Files written:** `types.rs`, `config.rs`, `score.rs`  
**Verified:** `cargo test` green; config.json written and re-read correctly.

---

## Phase 2 — Cross-Platform Process + Connection Monitor (Polling) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** connections flow into the terminal. No GUI yet.

- [x] `src/process/mod.rs` — `ProcessInfo` struct; `collect(pid) -> ProcessInfo`
      - name, path, user via `sysinfo::System`
      - parent name + pid via `sysinfo::Process::parent()`
      - service name (Windows: `EnumServicesStatusExW`, others: empty)
- [x] `src/process/publisher.rs` — `#[cfg(windows)]` `get_publisher(path) -> String`
      Reads PE version info via `windows-rs` `VerQueryValueW`.
      Cache in `std::sync::OnceLock<DashMap<String, String>>`.
- [x] `src/monitor/poll.rs` — `poll_connections(cfg, known) -> Vec<ConnEvent>`
      - Windows: `GetExtendedTcpTable` + `GetExtendedUdpTable` via `windows-rs`
      Filter status: ESTABLISHED, LISTEN, SYN_SENT, SYN_RECV, CLOSE_WAIT
- [x] `src/monitor/mod.rs` — `Monitor` struct; `start()` launches `spawn_blocking` loop;
      exposes `broadcast::Receiver<ConnEvent>`
- [x] Wire into `main.rs`: print each ConnEvent to stdout

**Verified:** Vigil running; browser connections visible in terminal within poll interval.

---

## Phase 3 — ETW Real-Time Monitor (Windows) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** connections detected in <100 ms instead of up to 5 seconds.

- [x] `src/monitor/etw.rs` — `#[cfg(windows)]`
      - NT Kernel Logger ETW session via `StartTraceW` (classic MOF, no TDH needed)
      - `EVENT_TRACE_FLAG_NETWORK_TCPIP` (`0x0001_0000`) for TCP events
      - `ProcessTrace` in dedicated `std::thread::spawn` (blocking); `CloseTrace` on exit
      - Parse classic `TcpIpV4` 20-byte payload for opcodes 12 (connect) / 18 (accept)
      - Fire `RawConn` via `OnceLock<UnboundedSender<RawConn>>` global callback context
- [x] `src/monitor/mod.rs` — hybrid: ETW fast path via `tokio::select!` + periodic poll
      fallback (every 30–60 s) for closed connections and startup snapshot
- [x] Startup poll captures pre-existing connections before ETW begins
- [x] `tokio::select!` with `recv_etw()` helper (returns `pending()` when ETW inactive)

**Verified:** ETW fires within milliseconds of a new TCP connection.

---

## Phase 4 — Tray + Notifications + Autostart ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** vigil sits in the system tray, shows notifications, survives reboot.

- [x] `src/tray.rs` — tray icon + Win32 event loop
- [x] `src/notifier.rs` — `send_alert(&ConnInfo)` via `notify-rust` (fire-and-forget)
- [x] `src/autostart.rs` — privilege-aware autostart handling
- [x] First-run logic in `main.rs` — enables autostart and sets `first_run_done = true`

---

## Phase 5 — GUI (egui) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Activity + Alerts tables
- [x] Inspector panel
- [x] Settings panel
- [x] Help panel
- [x] Tray/UI wiring and persisted state

---

## Phase 6 — Logging + Polish ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Daily rolling logs
- [x] Audit log stream
- [x] Tray shortcuts and app icon polish
- [x] Versioning and taskbar identity

---

## Phase 7 — Build + Distribution ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] DGA entropy signal
- [x] Reverse DNS cache

---

## Phase 11 — Active Response ✅ FEATURE COMPLETE

Move Vigil from passive observer to intervening defender. All actions must be explicit, reversible, and auditable.

### Per-connection and per-process blocking
- [x] **Block single connection** — Windows implementation via `SetTcpEntry` / delete-TCB
- [x] **Block all connections from a process** — reversible firewall rules scoped to the executable path, with TTL support
- [x] **Active-response UX** — countdowns, unblock actions, privilege-state UI, confirmations
- [x] **Block remote IP / CIDR** system-wide
- [x] **Block remote domain** through reversible hosts-file edits
- [x] **Kill process**
- [x] **Suspend / resume process**

### Machine-wide lockdown
- [x] **Panic button — full network isolation**
- [x] **Allowlist-only mode** — trusted list + operator allowlist + current Microsoft-signed system processes are treated as allowed; non-allowlisted traffic becomes a process-block candidate
- [x] **Quarantine profile** — Windows containment flow now includes:
  - isolate network
  - block executable path when known
  - suspend process when possible
  - disable USB storage
  - pause non-Microsoft scheduled tasks
  - clear-quarantine restores those controls where possible
- [x] **Break-glass recovery** — scheduled watchdog + heartbeat-based automatic recovery from stale isolation lockout

### Rule engine and automation
- [x] **User-defined response rules** — YAML rule file with first-match semantics, dry-run support, and actions for `kill_connection`, `block_remote`, `block_process`, and `quarantine`
- [x] **Threshold escalation** — repeated offences escalate through the built-in auto-response planner
- [x] **Time-boxed blocks** — TTL-backed automatic expiry and reconciliation
- [x] **Scheduled lockdown** — configurable start/end isolation window in Settings

### Containment and forensics
- [x] **PCAP capture on alert** — short `pktmon` window written as `pcapng`
- [x] **Process memory dump on alert** — Windows full-dump capture on sufficiently high-score alerts
- [x] **Freeze autorun entries** — Run / RunOnce baseline capture and rollback
- [x] **Honeypot decoy files** — decoy files in common user locations, synthetic alert on touch, optional auto-isolation

### Operator surface and docs
- [x] Settings UI exposes allowlist-only mode, response rules, honeypot decoys, scheduled lockdown, break-glass recovery, and forensic controls
- [x] Help tab documents the completed Phase 11 feature set
- [x] Example YAML rule file added at `response-rules.example.yaml`

**Important note:** feature-complete here means the planned Phase 11 capability set is implemented in the branch. A fresh full build / test / validation pass is still recommended before calling the branch production-stable.

---

## Phase 12 — Detection Depth 🚧 IN PROGRESS

Goal: deepen confidence on suspicious process behaviour while keeping scoring explainable, operator-auditable, and conservative enough for a workstation defender.

### Implemented in this branch
- [x] **Behavioural baselines** — per-process remote / port / country novelty tracking with persisted baseline state and maturity gating
- [x] **Script-host inspection** — PowerShell / WSH / mshta / regsvr32 / rundll32 / cmd heuristics for encoded, stealthy, or remote-execution style command lines
- [x] **Signed-but-malicious detection** — signed binaries can still receive extra score when strong corroboration signals stack
- [x] **LoLBAS / script proxy expansion** — more signed-binary proxy-execution and script-launch patterns feed the scorer
- [x] **Parent / token anomaly heuristics** — sensitive system ancestry plus script-capable children now raise explicit reasons and ATT&CK-style tags
- [x] **MITRE ATT&CK mapping** — process groups and selected connections carry ATT&CK-style tags into the UI and inspector
- [x] **Operator surface** — Activity / Alerts cards show Phase 12 badges (`SCR`, `BASE`) and the inspector exposes Phase 12 heuristic chips and ATT&CK mappings

### Still remaining before Phase 12 can be called complete
- [ ] **TLS SNI / JA3 fingerprinting**
- [ ] **Driver-backed / kernel-assisted tampering signals** beyond current user-mode ancestry heuristics
- [ ] **Fresh validation pass** — build, tests, and false-positive review for the new detection-depth signals
- [ ] **Final docs / release notes polish** once the implementation stabilises

**Important note:** this branch now contains a substantial Phase 12 implementation, but it should still be treated as in-progress until the new paths are validated end-to-end.
